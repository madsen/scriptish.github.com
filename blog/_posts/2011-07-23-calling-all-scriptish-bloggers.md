I'm looking for guest bloggers that may be interested in writing a post or two
for the new [Scriptish blog](http://scriptish.org/blog.html).
You can either write about Scriptish, JavaScript, 
or user scripts in general.  Somehow the post would have to be relevant to user
script authors, which I suspect will be the primary audience.

What will you get out of it?

* At least one link to your site.
* Fame?
* A chance to reach a wider audience.
* Fame?

Whatever it is you get out of it, you should know that [all content on this site
is public domain](http://scriptish.org/license.html) unless you state otherwise.

So, if you're ever interested all you need to do is [fork the repository for
this site](https://github.com/scriptish/scriptish.github.com/), and write a
post! for example [the source for this post can be found
here](https://github.com/scriptish/scriptish.github.com/tree/master/blog/_posts/2011-07-23-calling-all-scriptish-bloggers.md).
