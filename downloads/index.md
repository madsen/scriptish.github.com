title: Install Scriptish
---

There are three channels from which you can install Scriptish, the official AMO
channel which is the most stable and least current, the staging channel which is
usually stable and updated a little more frequently, or the nightly channel
which is updated every day and far more likely to have problems.

## [AMO](http://addons.mozilla.com/)

The AMO release is reviewed by Mozilla's AMO Editors who diligently test and
review the source versions released through this channel. So it is by far the
most stable, and least current version.

## Staging

For beta releases and official releases you can install Scriptish from the
staging channel.

## Nightlies

Every night a new installable add-on file is produced from what is currently in the developer repository, for brave users to test.

_Beware:_ Nightly builds might be unstable or outright broken!
