[Scriptish 0.1.3 was released on AMO yesterday](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/scriptish/),
it includes a number of new features such as a new icon designed by [Slowpoke]!

If you'd like to see a full feature list then you should check out the [version
history] wiki page.

I'd like to thank [Greg Parris] and [Nils Maier] for all of their hard work on
this release, and 0.1.4 which is shaping up to be a great one, so watch out for
it next month!
